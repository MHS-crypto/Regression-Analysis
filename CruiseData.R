# The number of crew members on a cruise ship tends to increase as the ship's size (tonnage), the number of passengers, the ship's length, and the number of cabins increase. In simpler terms, larger ships with more passengers, longer lengths, and more cabins typically require a larger crew to operate effectively.
# there also seam to be a high correlation between passengers & cabins
